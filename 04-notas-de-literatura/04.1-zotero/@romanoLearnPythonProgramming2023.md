>[!cite]  Python names are the closest abstraction to what other languages call variables. Names basically refer to objects and are introduced by name-binding operations” Yellow Highlight [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RU5PRU5U?page=50&annotation=TYE92A2J) 
 
>[!cite]  They need to be kept somewhere so that whenever we need to retrieve those objects, we can use their names to fetch them. We need some space to hold them, hence: namespaces!” Yellow Highlight [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RU5PRU5U?page=51&annotation=I5C5RUM2) 
 
>[!cite]  A namespace is a mapping from names to objects.” Yellow Highlight [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RU5PRU5U?page=51&annotation=VD8GIDEV) 
 
>[!cite]  global names in a module, and the local names in a function. Even the set of attributes of an object can be considered a namespace.” Yellow Highlight [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RU5PRU5U?page=51&annotation=B2FMY47D) 
 
>[!cite]  There is another concept, closely related to that of a namespace, which we would like to mention briefly: scope” Yellow Highlight [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RU5PRU5U?page=51&annotation=FCX6VRNA)
